How to flash images into the SAMA5D4 board.

The Linux4SAM (http://www.at91.com/linux4sam/bin/view/Linux4SAM/)
provides more information on flashing a binary file to the SAMA5D4
board. 

Here is brief information based on a Linux machine. Assume that
SAM-BA is already installed in Linux machine.
Refer to http://www.atmel.com/tools/ATMELSAM-BAIN-SYSTEMPROGRAMMER.aspx

Set the PATH environmental variable to include the directory of sam-ba
executable.

 - make sure /dev/ttyACMx is generated of not when teh board went to romboot.
 - if ttyACMx is different from /dev/ttyACM0, then edit the demo_linux_nandflash.sh.
 - execute ./demo_linux_nandflash.sh.
 - check if =Done= is written from logfile.log or your serial program for example, minicom or putty.
